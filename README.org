* OCIM-BGC-48layer model

*** Code_48layer: src, driver, results, and make_datafile
- src: Source code for BGC modeling
- driver: Main driver for BGC modeling
- results: Model output (data, tunable parameters, other parameters)
- make_datafile: Make the datafile for 48layer model (i.e., pme, NPP from satelite data...)

*** DATA: Supporting data used to run the inverse model

*** Observation_rawdata: Observational results from WOA, GLODAP, GEOTRACES, Satellite ... 

*** Transport_Operator: Download TR operator (48L) from previous study and make new msks for 48layer

* To do list
*** (1) Parameterize the vertical structure of NPP
*** (2) Do timestepping method for DICant after finishing first run for BGC inverse model to get optimized biogeochemical parameters.
